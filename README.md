This is a lab I did for my Principles of Programming Languages class in December 2017. It was my first time using Javascript! We had been working in FORTH in the class, so my final project was to implement a FORTH calculator with a twist; I had to do so by creating my own terminal in a little website using only HTML and Javascript.

Here's a discussion I did on the project with some screenshots of what the interface looks like:
